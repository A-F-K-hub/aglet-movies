MERN movie app

Integrated the backend(Node.js & MongoDB) and frontend(React.js)

Open app: http://localhost:3000

When running on local server, there are 2 files in the mern-mv folder: api(backend) and client(frontend). 

On seperate terminals in your code editor, 'cd' each folder(api, client) respectively, then 'npm start' both to run the backend and front end concurrently.
